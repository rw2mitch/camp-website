# camp-website
This is a simple and unfinished HTML website that I made for educational purposes while working as an online camp counsellor with Engineering Science Quest at the University of Waterloo. The camp was focused on teaching kids about STEM, and they were learning some coding, so I thought it would be fun to show them what they can do with coding while also providing a helpful resource.

The website contains an introduction to my group's camp counsellors, relevant videos, pictures, and a snake game I found somewhere (I'll add a link if I can find it). It also detects the date and posts a picture and description of what we will be doing in camp that day.

In the development of this website I was able to refine my understanding of the basics of CSS, which has helped me significantly in programming cognitive tasks.
